title: Idea for a Project - Solar System Visualisation
published: true
---
I've thought up a good project to get me going - a tool, probably in Python using [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org) to visualise solar systems from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

I intend this to be a project to get me started in creating tools to share (my day job work cannot be shared unfortunately) - and this at least will be a tool I will use.  But it may also lead to new ideas and maybe something unique that other people will want to use :)

I have created a repository at [github](https://github.com/dhjc/bruno) - and will try to put an basic example using our own solar system up soon.
