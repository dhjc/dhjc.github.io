title: Completed Data-driven Astronomy Course
published: true
---
I've recently completed the [Data Driven Astronomy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy) course, although there are still some non-graded exercises I still want to complete.  It was a fantastic course, and it is great to see some of the machine learning algorithms I've used before in this context.

It has really reinforced my conviction that getting back into Astrophysics is a great way to develop my data science skills outside of work, on a subject area that has always been close to my heart.  I hope to develop my own projects on Github and contribute to others, as well as writing some more detailed blog posts & walk-throughs on this site.
