title: Trying out D3js

After running through the tutorials on [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com) I've had a go at making a prototype of the exoplanet system visualisation I want to make [in D3]({{ site.url }}/bruno_d3_prototype.html).  It is definitely more difficult than using bokeh and python, but I get the feeling I have a lot more control over how it appears.  There is less of the easy-to-add bokeh functionality though.

Also, instead of entering data manually for our solar system, the tool looks up names in the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) and returns the required data.  You do need to know the specific name used so I've given a few examples - but translating what the user enters into the correct name will be an interesting future challenge.
