title: Solar System Viz - First Prototype
published: true
---


I've put together a [first prototype]({{ site.url }}/sol_prototype.html) of what the exoplanet visualiser I'm thinking about could output.  This is based on our solar system - but I'll use data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive using their API, for example [HD 10180](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/nstedAPI/nph-nstedAPI?table=exoplanets&select=pl_hostname,pl_radj,pl_name,pl_letter,pl_orbsmax&order=dec&format=json&where=pl_hostname%20like%20%27HD%2010180%27) ([wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_10180)).  It doesn't really work well on mobile/touch screen as it is currently set up though.
