I've completed week one of the course, good introduction to working with FITS files.  I'm saving the key code in a private Github respository at the moment as they working solutions to the course questions.  I will look for a starter project I can start in a public repository as soon as possible (but in reality probably not until I've completed the course) - and I figure once the code is adapted to that it'll be good to share.

Impressed with the course so far though, and good to start learning [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) :)
