As a first step towards combining my enjoyment of Astrophysics (in which I got a Masters in 2005) with my current Data Science role, I have just started [Data Driven Astronomy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy).  Looks like a good start to getting back into Astronomy.  Will see what the course is like, but I hope to be able to blog here and start a small project on github soon.
